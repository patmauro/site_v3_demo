PERSONAL WEBSITE
================

I have had some form of "home" on the internet since 2007, but I finally built a site on my own in 2013 and have been improving it over time ever since. This demo version removes the blog and simplifies the site into a version that is most indicative of the work I have personally put into it. Every line of every file was hard-coded by me personally.

Built entirely from scratch, the current version uses a custom PHP "framework" layered on top of hard-coded HTML and CSS to to keep site fully unified and remove any and all uneccessary duplication and inject custom fields only when necessary. The next iteration will also inject into the custom WordPress as well, rather than keeping the appearances matched manually.

Utilizes Google Fonts to maintain a unified appearance on all platforms and browsers. Fully HTML5 compliant.

For a more professional project I would of course implement a popular, responsive framework, but in this case I was more concerned with creating a "fully home-grown" project.
