<h1>About Me</h1>
<!--<img src="images/meus_alt.jpg" width="150px" height="150px" title="Credit to Gadget Photography for the photograph"> -->
<p>I am a goofy guy first and foremost - but I am also a programmer, musician and composer. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Vassar College, where I majored in Computer Science and minored in Music Composition. I am also a trained singer and actor - I began studying acting and voice professionally in 2005, and only stopped in college, when my interests gravitated more towards technology.</p>

<p>The work I enjoy most involves the merging of my technical and artistic skills - good examples being music scoring, audio engineering, and web design. While I mainly work in development, I'd also like to further develop my skills and experience with audio engineering, and music, where applicable. Though I don't have any experience, I'd love to pursue game development - in particular, video game music composition and sound production.</p>

<p>This site was created <b>entirely from scratch</b> (with the exception of my blog, which is powered by a custom WordPress) using a combination of php, html, css, javascript, and Adobe Fireworks (for image assets) and is fully HTML5-compliant.</p>
